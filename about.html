          <dt>What Should I Bring to the Gym?</dt>
          <dd>
            Answer: It's always a good idea to pack essentials like a water
            bottle, towel, and workout attire. Depending on your workout
            routine, you may also want to bring weightlifting gloves, resistance
            bands, or a yoga mat.

        <dl>
          <dt>How Often Should I Work Out?</dt>
          <dd>
            The frequency of your workouts depends on your fitness goals,
            schedule, and overall health. It's generally recommended to aim for
            at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of
            vigorous activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening
            exercises on two or more days per week.

        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>Should I Eat Before or After Working Out?</dt>
          <dd>
            It's important to fuel your body with a balanced meal or snack
            before and after your workout to optimize performance and recovery.
            Aim to eat a combination of carbohydrates and protein about 1-3
            hours before exercising, and refuel with a snack or meal containing
            protein and carbohydrates within 30-60 minutes post-workout.

        </dl>
        <dl>
          <dt>How Do I Prevent Injury During Workouts?</dt>
          <dd>
            To prevent injury during workouts, it's important to warm up
            properly before exercising, use correct form and technique,
            gradually increase intensity and duration, and listen to your body's
            signals. Incorporating a variety of exercises, including strength
            training, flexibility work, and balance exercises, can also help
            reduce the risk of injury.

          <dt>What's the Best Way to Stay Motivated?</dt>
          <dd>
            Staying motivated can be challenging, but setting realistic goals,
            tracking your progress, finding activities you enjoy, and mixing up
            your routine can help keep you engaged and excited about your
            fitness journey. Surrounding yourself with supportive friends or
            joining group classes can also provide accountability and
            encouragement to stay on track.
